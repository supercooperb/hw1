P&amp;E Homework 1
P&amp;E For this assignment, I chose to create multiple variants of the bubble.html code. I made different sizes, colors, and movement speed of the bubbles in each html file, while experimenting with different variables. This is my first time diving into code, so there is still a lot for me to learn. But I feel like I know a lot more about executing code. Enjoy!
